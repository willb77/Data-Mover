Data-Mover 
A Go subscriber service that Consumes data from GCP Pub/Sub Topic. A Go producer service that puts or writes data into a Kafka Topic
You must install and configure the CLI tools for GCP, and Kafka. Install Go in your development environment. Use your favorite IDE (I used GoLand)
I will add more robust error handling in the future.
