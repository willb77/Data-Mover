Data-Mover 
A Go subscriber service Consumes data from GCP Pub/Sub Topic
A Go producer puts data into a Kafka Topic
You will have to install and configure the CLI tools for GCP, and Kafka. Install Go in your development environment. Use your favorite IDE (I used GoLand)
I will add more robust error handling in the future.
